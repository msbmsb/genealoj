GenealoJ is a Java parser for GEDCOM[1] files. Due to most previously-available 
GEDCOM parsers having a class for potentially each of the 130 tags[2], GenealoJ
is written in the simplest way possible with as few as possible classes to deal 
with. Currently there are 2 classes total:

GenealoJ: The main parsing & container class
GedcomNode: A generic node for a gedcom line. Holds level, tag, reference, data
 and children nodes.

(More documentation soon)
